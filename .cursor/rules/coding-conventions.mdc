# Coding Conventions

## TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for type safety in both frontend and backend
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use explicit return types on functions

## React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- One component per file
- Use named exports
- Component files named with PascalCase

## Backend
- Use Express router for API endpoints
- Controller functions should be separated by resource
- Database models should handle all data operations
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
